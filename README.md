## THEORY

## Calculating Pumping Speed

Formula Used:

**S = dV/dt = Av**

where, 

S = Pumping Speed

dV/dt = Volume of gas flowing per unit time through the pipe

A = Area of the pipe

v = Velocity of gas flowing through the pipe


## Calculating Throughput:

Formula Used:

**Q = P * S**

where, 

S = Pumping Speed

P = Pressure at inlet

Q = Throughput
